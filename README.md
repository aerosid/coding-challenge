Dear Sidharth,

At this point in our interview process, we invite you to a systems engineering assessment where you'll implement a small API that conforms to a given set of specifications. You'll be given three hours for just a single question that can be programmed in any of the following languages (and possibly more): Python 3.4, Java 8, C++14. But we highly recommend that you choose one of the higher-level languages for your own productivity's sake.

If you haven't had a chance to do so already, please feel free to try out the practice assessment (linked below) to familiarize yourself with the coding environment. The coding environment is interactive, and allows you to run your tentative solution using several sample test cases provided with each question. Whenever you submit your solution -- you can do this as many times as you want -- it's passed through a more comprehensive set of test cases that could help you identify any remaining bugs. Although it's not strictly necessary, please try to type directly into the solution box instead of copy-pasting what you've coded up separately in a text editor or IDE.

One last request: we kindly ask that you do not seek any outside help during this assessment, with the sole exception being the documentation for your programming language/framework.

Best of luck, and reach out if you have any questions.
